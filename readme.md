## Topics competition work

I did a lot of research, 4 diferent collabs an so on, diferent features and other things

Different models, using GridSearchCV to find the best one.

The chosen one was Random Forest Classification.

The f1 score is an array because it's for both classes, as seen in the scikit learn documentation

Run the main.py, also import the libraries :) that's all
